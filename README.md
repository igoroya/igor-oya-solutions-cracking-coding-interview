# igor-oya-solutions-cracking-coding-interview
My personal storage for solutions of the Cracking Coding Interview  (6th ed.) book by Gayle Laakmann MacDowel (ed. CareerCup LLC). 

Will start with Python solutions, may likely continue with Java, C++ or Ruby.

I'l try to find solutions without looking to existing solutions and from the top of my head, thus these solutions my not be most efficient or in the most pythonic shape. I'll be adding additional and more polished solutions from time to time.
